Question: What type of cybersecurity threat is perhaps most uniquely, given the
          nature of it, a risk in a research project like SETI@Home, and how might that threat materialize?
Answer: The primary threat is the potential for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities in the
        software or hardware used by the project. This threat materializes in the form of distributed
        denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, where attackers overwhelm the project's servers with a
        flood of requests, rendering them unable to process legitimate requests.

Question: What are zero-day attacks and why are they a threat?
Answer: Zero-day attacks refer to cyberattacks that target vulnerabilities in software, hardware, or
        firmware that are unknown to the vendor or the public. These attacks are threat because the
        target organization has no time to develop a defense against them, as they are only
        discovered after the attack has already occurred.

Question: What is port scanning and how is it a threat?
Answer: Port scanning is a method used to determine which ports on a network are open and could
        be receiving or sending data. It can pose a threat as it can be used by cybercriminals to
        verify or check the security policies of a network and identify vulnerabilities, which they can
        then exploit to gain unauthorized access.

Question: What are supercookies? Via what means do we most commonly
          obtain/receive them, and how do they create threats to our systems?
Answer: Supercookies are a type of pseudo-malicious file that tracks online behavior, similar to
        regular HTTP cookies. They are more difficult to detect and remove because they don't exist
        in normal cookie storage locations. Supercookies can be obtained/received through two
        means: Flash cookies (Local Shared Objects or LSOs) and Internet Service Provider (ISP)
        supercookies. They pose threats to user privacy by enabling extensive tracking across
        websites and creating detailed user profiles.

Question: What makes a worm distinct from a virus?
Answer: Worms are self-replicating and can spread independently, exploiting vulnerabilities in
        computer networks without requiring a host file. On the other hand, viruses need a host file
        to attach themselves to and rely on user interactions to spread. Viruses can carry
        destructive payloads but may be less noticeable than worms, which tend to cause a more
        visible impact on network traffic.

Question: Provide a technological example of "security through obscurity".
Answer: Hiding network ports by changing their default assignments.

Question: Distinguish the concepts of SSH and VPN.
Answer: SSH is focused on secure remote access and command execution on a specific device,
        while VPNs are more broadly used to create secure and encrypted connections between
        networks or to provide secure access to resources over the internet.

Question: What purpose does the X.509 standard serve?
Answer: The X.509 standard serves as a framework for defining the format and infrastructure of
        public-key certificates (PKI) that securely associates cryptographic key pairs of public and
        private keys with websites, individuals, or organizations.

Question: Why might a company want to perform pen testing?
Answer: Penetration testing is a proactive and strategic approach to cybersecurity that helps
        organizations identify, assess, and address vulnerabilities, ultimately enhancing their overall
        security posture and resilience against cyber threats.

Question: Of the below HTTP status codes, which most likely suggests that a
          distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack may be occurring?
Answer: 503 Service Unavailable
