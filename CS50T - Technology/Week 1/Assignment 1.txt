Question: If, like me, you sometimes count using your fingers, odds are you can count up to 5 things
          on one hand (using 5 fingers). But that's if you're using "unary" notation, whereby you only
          have a single digit (pun intended) at your disposal, a finger, which you can think of as a 1.
          Binary, by contrast, allows you to use two digits, 0 and 1. How high could you count on one
          hand (with 5 fingers) using binary? Assume that a raised finger represents a 1 and a lowered
          finger represents a 0.
Answer: 31

Question: Recall that we looked at ASCII in lecture, which uses just 7 or 8 bits to represent letters
          of the alphabet. Read up on "Unicode," as via Google, and explain in your own words how Unicode
          is able to represent many more symbols than can ASCII, which is particularly helpful for written
          languages with many more characters than English.
Answer: Unicode is a character encoding standard designed to represent a wide range of symbols and characters
        from almost all writing systems in the world, overcoming the limitations of ASCII which can only
        handle 128 or 256 characters. It uses different encoding formats such as UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32,
        which allow millions of characters to be represented by combinations of 1 to 4 bytes, in contrast
        to the 7 or 8 bits used by ASCII.

Question: Describe at least one key difference, other than size/storage capacity, between RAM and hard disk.
Answer: RAM is extremely fast-access volatile memory, used to store data and programs in active use by
        the processor, allowing for near-instant operations. In contrast, the hard drive is a much slower,
        non-volatile memory, suitable for long-term storage of data and programs, with access times that can
        take milliseconds.

Question: Some computers, particularly PCs, come with stickers that say "Intel Inside." What is it that's
          inside of most computers that's made by Intel? In your own words, what does that hardware do?
Answer: Inside is the CPU (Central Processing Unit), essential for the operation of the computer. The CPU
        executes program instructions, performs calculations, and manages the flow of data in the system.

Question: What purpose does a device driver serve?
Answer: A device driver is software that allows the operating system to communicate with and control
        a computer's hardware. It acts as a translator between the device and applications or the
        operating system, ensuring that commands and data are understood and executed correctly by the hardware.

Question: Even though both are wireless, how does Wi-Fi differ from Bluetooth? You're welcome to Google
          as needed, but take care to distinguish the two in your own words.
Answer: Wi-Fi focuses on providing high-speed internet access and local networks, ideal for connecting
        devices over long distances and transferring large amounts of data. On the other hand, Bluetooth
        focuses on short-distance connections and low energy consumption, being perfect for linking nearby
        devices quickly and easily.
