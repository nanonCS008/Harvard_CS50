Question: In what sense are files not actually deleted even if you empty the recycle bin on Windows or
          empty the trash on macOS?
Answer: The files are not actually deleted from the hard drive; They are simply dereferenced, marking
        the space as available for overwriting. The data remains on the drive until it is overwritten
        with new data, allowing it to be recovered with specialized tools until this occurs.

Question: How, using cookies, does a web server actually remember that you're logged in?
Answer: The server generates a unique session identifier and sends it to your browser in the form of a cookie.
        This cookie is automatically included in each subsequent request to the server, allowing it to recognize
        and verify your active session. This way, the server remembers that you are logged in and allows you
        to access protected resources without repeatedly asking for your credentials.

Question: Suppose you've forgotten your password to some website. Even though you can likely reset your
          password via a link on the website, odds are no one at the company can actually tell you your
          forgotten password. Why not?
Answer: No one in the company can tell you the forgotten password because passwords are stored as irreversible
        hashes, not in clear text. This means that when you create a password, the website converts it to a
        hash using a one-way function that cannot be reversed to the original password.

Question: Why is "phishing" such a difficult problem to prevent?
Answer: It is difficult to prevent due to the sophistication of social engineering techniques used by attackers,
        the lack of online security awareness and education on the part of many people, the adaptability of
        attacks to bypass security measures, the ease of execution of attacks even for people with low technical
        skill, the exploitation of human factors such as trust and urgency, and the ability of attackers to
        avoid detection through evasion techniques.

Question: Suppose that you're visiting a country in which some website is blocked. How, technically, might
          using a VPN allow you to visit that website nonetheless?
Answer: The VPN assigns an IP address from the VPN server's country, masking your original blocked IP,
        and encrypts your data while you browse. This tricks the blocked website into thinking you are in
        the VPN server's country, allowing you to access the site and receive data over the VPN connection.
