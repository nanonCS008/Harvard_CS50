Question: When might you want to use a GIF instead of a JPEG?
Answer: Consider using a GIF instead of a JPEG when you need to create simple animations, images with
        transparency, line art, or when file size is a major concern and you don't need the visual quality
        that a JPEG offers for more complex images.

Question: When might you want to use a JPEG instead of a GIF?
Answer: Consider using a JPEG instead of a GIF when working with photographs, images with smooth gradients,
        detailed artwork, images for high-quality printing, or any situation where visual quality is a priority
        and you don't need specific features such as animation or transparency that it offers. the GIF format.

Question: Let's assume that these images are the same resolution -- 300 pixels by 200 pixels, and both are
          static (non-video/non-looping) GIFs. Nevertheless, it turns out that the German GIF is smaller
          (i.e., fewer bytes) than the French GIF. Hypothesize why that might be.
Answer: Be sure to re-read this stipulation carefully. When you download these images, you may find that the
        German GIF is bigger, for example (there are different GIF-encoding techniques which can cause this).
        Nevertheless, we are stipulating that they are both 300x200, and that the German one is smaller,
        and that should be your assumption in your answer.
        The German GIF could be smaller than the French GIF due to a more limited color palette that reduces
        image complexity, simpler patterns or details on the German flag, more efficient compression optimization,
        and possibly a more efficient arrangement of colors in the palette, resulting in a smaller file size
        without significantly sacrificing visual quality.

Question: Why does making an image bigger not make it clearer?
Answer: Enlarging an image does not make it clearer because you are simply enlarging existing
        pixels without adding new details or information.

Question: In what way is a childhood "flip book" like a digital video?
Answer: A children's flip book and a digital video are similar in that they both use sequences of images,
        visual storytelling, interactivity and movement elements to capture children's attention and convey
        content in an engaging and dynamic way.
