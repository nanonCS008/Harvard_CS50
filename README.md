# Amnuaysilpa Extracurricular Hub

A modern web app for browsing and managing student clubs at Amnuaysilpa.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Prisma ORM
- NextAuth (Credentials)
- SQLite (default) / PostgreSQL (prod-ready)
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started (Local)
1. Copy env file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Generate Prisma client and push schema:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
4. Seed sample data:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
5. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Open http://localhost:3000

### Test Accounts
- Leader: 62001@student.amnuaysilpa.ac.th / Password123!
- Student: 62002@student.amnuaysilpa.ac.th / Password123!

## Major Features
- Browse clubs with filters by day and category
- Club details with apply button
- Student dashboard with joined clubs and announcements
- Club leader dashboard: approve/reject, manage roles, export CSV, edit profile, post announcements
- Admin dashboard: view clubs, leaders, and member counts

## Export Members
Visit `/club-leader` and click Export CSV for your club.

## Deployment
- Vercel recommended. Set env vars in Vercel Project Settings:
  - DATABASE_PROVIDER ("postgresql" if using Vercel Postgres)
  - DATABASE_URL
  - NEXTAUTH_URL (your production URL)
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (generate a secure value)
- Run prisma migration or `prisma db push` as a build step if needed.

## Switching to PostgreSQL
Set in `.env`:
```
DATABASE_PROVIDER=postgresql
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB?schema=public
```
Run:
```
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Add/Manage Clubs without coding
- Use the Admin dashboard `/admin` to view clubs and leaders.
- To add a club quickly, you can run Prisma Studio:
  ```bash
  npm run prisma:studio
  ```
  Then create a `Club` record interactively.

## Notes
- Email domain restricted to `@student.amnuaysilpa.ac.th` for sign-in.
- Replace `/public/logo.svg` and club images under `/public/clubs/*` with real assets.
